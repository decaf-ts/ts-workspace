### Description

THis is a template project for Typescript repos.

By developers, [for developers](./tutorials/For%20Developers.md).




## Considerations
 - Setup for a linux based environment (Sorry windows users. use WSL... or just change already);
 - Setup for node 20, but will work at least with 16;
 - Requires docker to build documentation (drawings and PlantUML)
