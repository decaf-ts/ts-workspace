## Tabnine prompts to generate decent documentation

### Root index file (/ts-doc-root)
 - scopes: file, workspace
```
Act as a seasoned typescript developer.
The current document is the root index of a module.
Define documentation block with:
 - a @module tag using the library name from package.json;
 - a thorough @description with a detailed analysis of the objective of the module, taken from analysing all the files imported by the current one;
also document all exported objects;
never omit or change any code
```

You're a senior TypeScript developer writing JSDoc documentation for a class to be used with better-docs. Given the module code:
Generate a JSDoc comment block for a TypeScript module file using better-docs formatting:
- Add @module with the name of the module
- Add @description and @summary
- Do NOT document individual exports
- The summary should explain the role of the module and what it exposes (classes, utils, etc.)
- Include references to key exported objects using @link where appropriate

Respond with only the JSDoc block for the module file.
never omit or change any code
```


### Index file (/ts-doc-index)
 - scopes: file, workspace
```
Act as a seasoned typescript developer.
The current document is the root of a namespace of a module.
Define documentation block with:
 - a @namespace tag using the appropriate name, given the folder it is on and all the files imported by the current one;
 - a thorough @description with a detailed analysis of the objective of the files in the current folder recrusively;
 - a @memberOf tag referencing the parent module;
also document all exported objects;
never omit or change any code
```


### Classes (/ts-doc-class)

```
Act as a seasoned typescript developer.
document the entire class and each of its functions including always including the @description tag with a short description of the target, and a@summary tag with a more detailed one.
Include @class tags when applicable.
include @param tags in the class documentation and its type definitions
Include detailed @description for all properties.
Include @template tags when necessary.
For methods and functions:
- include @description and @summary tags as defined for the target. also document every argument, including its type definition, and return type, referencing @template tags when necessary.
- create mermaid sequence diagrams under the @mermaid tag;

The order of tags  (when applicable) should be as follows:
1 - @description;
2 - @summary;
3 - @template;
4 - @param;
5 - @return;
6 - @class
7 - @mermaid;

ignore @mermaid for methods with less that 15 lines and constructors.
never omit or change any code
```

Generate a JSDoc comment block for a TypeScript class file using better-docs formatting:
- @class tag including the name
- @description and @summary for the class

- Do NOT document the constructor, but include the constructor arguments as @param in the class documentation
- For each class method (static and instance):
  - Add @description, @summary, @param, and @return tags
  - If the method has more than 10 lines, include a @mermaid sequence diagram
  - Include @private or @protected if applicable
  - Use @link when referring to other classes, types, or interfaces

Respond only with the full JSDoc comment block for the class and its methods.

- If it's an interface, use @interface
- Add @description and @summary for the interface/type
- Include @template for generic types
- For each method (in interfaces), include @param and @return
- For each property, document the purpose inline or using @property
